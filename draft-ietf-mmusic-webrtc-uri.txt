 WebRTC URI for remote resource identification and local configuration
                      draft-ietf-webrtc-uri-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that
   establishes a WebRTC session.  This URI serves two purposes.  First
   it will identify a remote a WebRTC agent.  Second it will configure
   the local WebRTC agent.

   This provides an alternative to the SDP Offer/Answer exchange
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-offer-answer].  The Offer/Answer is exchanged
   via a signaling plane that is controlled by the user
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-jsep].

1.  Introduction

   The WebRTC framework specifies protocol support for direct
   interactive rich communication using audio, video, and data between
   two peers.  WebRTC was originally designed with the browser in mind.
   Usage of WebRTC has extended far beyond that.

   The flexibility of WebRTC's signaling plane has made adoption
   difficult for some use cases.  The signaling plane also presents
   challenges around security, privacy and operational burden.  However
   WebRTC's media plane is unambiguous.  Once two WebRTC Agents have
   enough details from signaling it is easy to establish rich
   communication.

   The signaling plane is only necessary when two clients don't have
   enough information to establish a session.  In some cases signaling
   is not necessary.  If the two WebRTC agents agree on some basic
   details signaling is not required.  The greatest difficulty comes
   with establishing connectivity between two ICE Agents.
   [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis] If these two ICE Agents use mDNS
   [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns] and are in the same network you
   can establish a Zeroconf session.  If one ICE Agent is world routable
   connectivity is also easily possible.  The WebRTC URI format does not
   allow connectivity between two ICE Agents that would require STUN or
   TURN.

Internet-Draft                 WebRTC URI                 September 2020


   Multiple sessions can be established using the same set of WebRTC
   URIs.  This document describes a URI that contains these details.

   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MMUSIC IETF
   mailing list mmusic@ietf.org (mailto:mmusic@ietf.org) or on the
   GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/sean-
   der/webrtc-uri (https://github.com/sean-der/webrtc-uri).

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Use Cases

   Please note that this section is informational only.

2.1.  Use cases for Zeroconf

   *  Two users can play a P2P multiplayer video game.  No backend
      components are required for signaling.

   *  Two users can exchange a file without depending on a 3rd party
      server.

   *  A user can connect to their security camera in the same network.

   *  A user can cast their desktop or a video to another device.

2.2.  Use cases for World routable host

   *  A user can publish media real-time to a CDN

   *  A user can connect to a CDN to watch a real-time video

3.  The WebRTC URI Scheme

   The WebRTC URI takes two possible form

   webrtc://<ice-user-fragment>:<ice-password>@<mDNS name>?<paramaters>

   webrtc://<ice-user-fragment>:<ice-password>@<IP/Port>?<paramaters>

4.  Examples of WebRTC URI Syntax

   ## Zeroconf ## Public server

5.  Security, Privacy and Availability Benefits

   Without a WebRTC URI a signaling plane is required to establish a
   WebRTC session.

   If an attacker is able to modify messages they could MITM a WebRTC
   Session.  The attacker could replace the candidates and certificate
   fingerprint with their own.  They could then route all traffic
   through a host they control.  The two users would connect to each
   other and not realize that anything is wrong.

   If an attacker is able to observe messages they can extract valuable
   information around a session.  The attacker is able to determine when
   a call is taking place.  They are also able to determine how many
   media tracks are being exchanged.

   Many times two WebRTC agents are in the same LAN.  The signaling
   plane is usually run on a world routable server.  The WebRTC Agents
   may have direct connectivity with each other, but not be able to
   connect to the signaling plane.
